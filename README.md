# crosschain-dapp
A decentralized application to asset swap cross chain with Squid protocol, Axelar network  - Cosmos and Ethereum.  The solution architecture defined in this document is for a decentralized application that allows asset transfers and all DeFi related features that can be done across different chain.  This brainstorming version is to attempt a solution to swap assets from Ethereum network and transfer asset to a Cosmos network.

## Squid Architectural Design

# Use Case 

A high level design and walk through on a potential asset swaps and forwards could be done using the technologies listed on the Technical Stack section.

## Technical Stack

Below are the possible tech stacks that comprises an end to end solution.

1. [**Axelar Network**](https://axelar.network/) - is a decentralized state machine responsible for facilitating cross-chain requests.  Axelar network will be the bridge between the Squid protocol for asset swapping and transfer to another blockchain network.
2. [**Squid**](https://0xsquid.com/) - a liquidity and messaging router on Axelar network. It enables native token swaps and messaging between any user or application, regardless of the chain theyâ€™re on. Wrap our smart contracts, API and SDK to enable composable, cross-chain financial logic in the simplest possible way.
3. [**Cosmos**](https://cosmos.network) - is an application specific blockchain network.  Tendermint is used to build the blockchain and a series of API is  deloped to provide interaction and transactions of the blockchain. 

## Desgin Walk Through

We will use Axelar to the message transfer engine.

Squid's router protocol can be wrapped around a DApp application like Uniswap's asset swap dialog box or a smart contract on Ethereum's smart contract using Solidity.

From a Javascript (React or Nodejs) perspective, the code would look similar to the below code snippet.


`const result = await squid.route(
    0.183, 
    "eth", 
    "ethereum",
    "awc", 
    "cosmoshub-4",
);`
`const { route } = result;`
`const tx = squid.executeRoute(signer, route)`
`await tx.wait();`
`const status = await squid.getStatus(tx.hash);`

The logic to perform the swap is entirely application dependent.  For example, the asset swap logic can be based on **Uniswap's V3** routing protocol.

A function invocation of Axelar's **CallContractWithToken** will start the transfer of the swap result to the Cosmos chain.  After the Axelar gateway flow, the route will direct to Squid's Cosmos on-chain application. 

Cosmos is an application specific network.  An API is built top of tendermint to provide the functionalities of the transfer.
